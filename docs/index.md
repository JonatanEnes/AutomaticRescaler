# Serverless Containers documentation

The Serverless Containers framewowork has been developed at Univerisade da Coru√±a, in Spain, as part of a PhD thesis from the candidate [Jonatan Enes](http://jonatanenes.com/).

This framework is able to dynamically scale the container's resources (e.g., CPU, Memory, disk and network) in order to adapt them to the real usage, at any moment and in real-time.

In this page all the documentation is presented for the several microservices that compose the framework.

* In order to see data from real experiments where this tool was used, you can visit [this demo](http://bdwatchdog.dec.udc.es/TimeseriesViewer_DEMO/).
