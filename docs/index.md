![Logo](img/logo.png){: style="height:150px;width:100px;"} 

The **Serverless Containers** framework has been developed at Univerisade da Coru√±a, in Spain, as part of a PhD thesis from the candidate [Jonatan Enes](http://jonatanenes.com/).

This framework is able to **dynamically scale the container's resources (_e.g., CPU, Memory, disk and network_) in order to adapt them to the real usage**, at any moment and in real-time.

In this page all the documentation is presented for the several microservices that compose the framework.
